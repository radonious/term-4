# JavaFX desktop application

Main task: Make a runnable JavaFX application according to task option number. 
The main object is a bee. There are 2 types of them: drones and workers. 
Drones are born every N1 seconds if their number is less than K% of the total number of bees, otherwise not born at all. 
Workers are born every N2 seconds with probability P.

## Labs List
1) Runnable app according to main task with basic action handler
2) UI creation (Buttons, inputs, warning and modal menus, tool menu)
3) Collections (ArrayList of objects, HashSet of IDs, MapTree of bornTime)
4) Multi-thread simple AI for objets, checkBoxes in UI to stop AI
5) App console, config files support, serialization
6) TCP/IP connection support, object sending to another client
7) PostgreSQL support, object save/load using DB
